//            2011-06-26 Migrated into Arduino library from OpenDCC codebase
//            2014 Added getAddr to NmraDcc  Geoff Bunza
//            2015-11-06 Martin Pischky (martin@pischky.de):
//                       Experimental Version to support 14 speed steps
//                       and new signature of notifyDccSpeed and notifyDccFunc
//            2017-11-29 Ken West (kgw4449@gmail.com):
//                       Added method and callback headers.
//
//------------------------------------------------------------------------
